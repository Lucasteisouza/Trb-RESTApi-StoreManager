# Back-end management of a fictional store using MSC architecture 

This repo was created as part of my formation in the Back-end modulo at @Trybe.

Our main goal was to create a small application capable of handling user requests following the http protocols, and following the Model, Service, Control architecture paradigm. To achieve this, the library Express and mysql2 were used.

This project was developed in 3-4 days.

## How to run

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the .yaml file using `docker-compose up -d`
3. Execute the requisition using any req simulator (such as ThunderClient, Insomnia or PostMan)
